# CLIProxyAPI Plus

English | [Chinese](README_CN.md)

This is the Plus version of [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), adding support for third-party providers on top of the mainline project.

All third-party provider support is maintained by community contributors; CLIProxyAPI does not provide technical support. Please contact the corresponding community maintainer if you need assistance.

So you can use local or multi-account CLI access with OpenAI(include Responses)/Gemini/Claude-compatible clients and SDKs.

## Management API

see [MANAGEMENT_API.md](https://help.router-for.me/management/api)

## Amp CLI Support

CLIProxyAPI includes integrated support for [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com) and Amp IDE extensions, enabling you to use your Google/ChatGPT/Claude OAuth subscriptions with Amp's coding tools:

- Provider route aliases for Amp's API patterns (`/api/provider/{provider}/v1...`)
- Management proxy for OAuth authentication and account features
- Smart model fallback with automatic routing
- **Model mapping** to route unavailable models to alternatives (e.g., `claude-opus-4.5` → `claude-sonnet-4`)
- Security-first design with localhost-only management endpoints

When you need the request/response shape of a specific backend family, use the provider-specific paths instead of the merged `/v1/...` endpoints:

- Use `/api/provider/{provider}/v1/messages` for messages-style backends.
- Use `/api/provider/{provider}/v1beta/models/...` for model-scoped generate endpoints.
- Use `/api/provider/{provider}/v1/chat/completions` for chat-completions backends.

These routes help you select the protocol surface, but they do not by themselves guarantee a unique inference executor when the same client-visible model name is reused across multiple backends. Inference routing is still resolved from the request model/alias. For strict backend pinning, use unique aliases, prefixes, or otherwise avoid overlapping client-visible model names.
